### Small Rainmeter suite with great flexibility

This suite was made to show [pyrmont](https://github.com/F1uctus/pyrmont) static skin generator possibilities.

`Config.inc` can be edited to use custom suite scale, colors, dark/light themes and English/Russian localizations.

### Requirements

- Place your GitHub feed key to the file `.\GitHub\Feed\token-github-feed.ignore.txt`

- Place your OpenWeatherMap API key to the file `.\Weather\token-openweathermap.ignore.inc` with format:
```
[Variables]
    token-openweathermap=YOUR_API_KEY
```

- If you are planning to customize this suite, `pyrmont` requires Python 3 on your machine. Also, it is used for GitHub feed scraping.

- [FrostedGlass](https://github.com/TheAzack9/FrostedGlass) plugin.

- There is a micro C# program allowing to get Windows accent color, so you'll need .NET Framework 4.7.2 or greater.
