## Small Rainmeter skin-pack with great flexibility

This suite was made to show [pyrmont](https://github.com/F1uctus/pyrmont) static skin generator possibilities.

`Config.inc` can be edited to use custom suite scale, colors, dark/light themes and English/Russian localizations.

## Requirements

To get Kite fully working, you must have Python 3 installed on your machine.

Also, this skin pack uses the [`FrostedGlass`](https://github.com/TheAzack9/FrostedGlass) plugin.

There is a micro C# program to allow to get Windows accent color,
so you'll need .NET Framework 4.7.2 or greater.
